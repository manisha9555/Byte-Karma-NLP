# Byte-Karma-NLP

Our project CodeViz focuses on developing an automated tool for generating explanations of code segments. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically the Word2Vec algorithm, the system analyzes code snippets and generates human-readable explanations.

Key Features:

**NLP Powered Explanation:** Utilizes the Word2Vec algorithm to automatically generate explanations for code segments.
**Custom Dataset:** We have curated our own dataset for training the model and continue to update it for enhanced performance.
**Ongoing Improvements:** Continuous refinement of preprocessing techniques and visualization methods to optimizeÂ results
